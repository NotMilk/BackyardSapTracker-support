## What it does

- **Dashboard** -- View sap flow days, gallons collected, and estimated syrup output. Switch between daily timeline and calendar view with weather conditions and sap flow predictions.

- **Tree and Tap Management** -- Add trees by species and location, install taps per tree per season. Track installation and pull dates, per-tap collection volumes, and season average Brix.

- **Sap Collection** -- Log collection by tap with optional Brix readings. Multiple collections per tap per day. Per-collection syrup estimates use the Rule of 86.

- **Boil Tracking** -- Record boil sessions with sap volume and syrup output. Sap Brix auto-calculated from collections. Identifies which collections were used and offers to mark them as boiled or discarded.

- **Weather Integration** -- Automatic weather data from Open-Meteo or the National Weather Service. Sap flow conditions calculated from daily highs and lows. Historical 5-year averages extend forecasts to 45 days.

- **Seasons** -- Each season has its own start and end date. Arbitrary past or future season years supported.

- **Data Export and Backup** -- Export as JSON or CSV. Choose individual tables for CSV export. Auto-backup to device storage.
