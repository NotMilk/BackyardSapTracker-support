# Data Export and Backup

## JSON export

A full JSON export includes all your data in a single file. Use this for complete backups or transferring data.

1. Open Settings.
2. Select Export Data.
3. Choose JSON format.
4. Save or share the file.

## CSV export

CSV export lets you pick individual tables to export:

- Collections
- Weather
- Taps
- Boils
- Fees

Each table exports as a separate CSV file. Useful for analysis in spreadsheet software.

1. Open Settings.
2. Select Export Data.
3. Choose CSV format.
4. Select the tables you want to export.
5. Save or share the files.

## Auto-backup

Auto-backup saves your data to device storage automatically. This protects against data loss from uninstalling the app.

1. Open Settings.
2. Enable Auto-Backup.

When you reinstall the app, it detects the backup and offers to restore your data.

**Note:** Auto-backup stores data on the device itself. It does not back up to a cloud service. For off-device backup, use JSON export and save the file to your preferred storage.
