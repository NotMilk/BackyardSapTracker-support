# Boil Tracking

## Recording a boil session

1. Open the boil tracking tab.
2. Start a new boil entry.
3. Enter sap volume using the inline unit picker.
4. Enter syrup output.
5. The Sap Brix field is auto-calculated from your recent collections. You can edit it manually if needed.
6. Save the boil.

## Linking collections to a boil

After saving a boil, the app identifies which sap collections were likely used. It offers to mark those collections as boiled or discarded. This keeps your available sap totals accurate.

## Summary widgets

The boil tracking tab shows summary widgets for:

- Available sap (collected but not yet boiled)
- Estimated output from available sap
- Total gallons boiled
- Total syrup produced
