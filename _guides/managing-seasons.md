# Managing Seasons

## How seasons work

Each season has a start date and end date, scoped to a year. All collections, boils, and tap installations are associated with a season.

## Creating a season

The app creates your first season during initial setup. To create additional seasons:

1. Open the season selector.
2. Create a new season for the desired year.
3. Set the start and end dates.

## Editing a season

Season start and end dates are editable at any time. Changing dates does not affect existing data -- it adjusts the date range the dashboard displays.

## Switching between seasons

Use the season selector to switch between past and current seasons. All dashboard data, collections, and boil records update to reflect the selected season.

## Past and future seasons

The app supports arbitrary past or future season years. You can create a season for any year to enter historical data or plan ahead.
