# Collecting Sap

## Logging a collection

1. Open the collection screen from the dashboard or the collections tab.
2. Select the tap you collected from.
3. Enter the volume collected.
4. Optionally enter a Brix reading for that collection.
5. Save the entry.

You can log multiple collections per tap per day. Each entry is recorded separately.

## Brix readings

Brix readings are optional but enable per-collection syrup estimates using the Rule of 86. If no Brix reading is provided, the app uses the species-specific default Brix shown on the tree card.

## Moving a collection to a different date

If you log a collection on the wrong date, you can move it after saving. Open the collection entry and change the date. The dashboard will update accordingly.

## Syrup estimates

The app calculates estimated syrup output per collection using the Rule of 86: divide 86 by the sap Brix to get the gallons of sap needed per gallon of syrup. Tap the syrup amount on the dashboard for a volume breakdown in gallons, quarts, pints, cups, and fluid ounces.
