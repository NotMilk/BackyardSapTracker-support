# Getting Started

When you first open the app, a setup wizard walks you through initial configuration.

## Step 1: Set your tree count

Enter the number of trees you plan to tap this season. You can change this later.

## Step 2: Tracking preferences

Choose what you want to track. The app supports sap collection, boil sessions, and both. Select what matches your workflow.

## Step 3: Weather setup

Enter your location for weather data. The app accepts:

- GPS coordinates (auto-detected from your device)
- US zip code
- Canadian postal code
- City name

Select your preferred weather provider (Open-Meteo or National Weather Service) and temperature unit (Fahrenheit or Celsius). The app auto-detects the appropriate unit from your location.

## Step 4: Add trees

Add your trees with species and location. The species selection dropdown shows Brix reference values for common maple species.

## Step 5: Install taps

Once trees are added, install taps on each tree. Each tap gets its own installation date and can be pulled independently at the end of the season.
