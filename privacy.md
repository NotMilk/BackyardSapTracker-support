# Privacy Policy

**Backyard Sap Tracker**
Last updated: February 2026

## Summary

Backyard Sap Tracker does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All app data is stored locally on your device.

## Data Storage

All data you enter into the app (trees, taps, sap collections, boil records, season data) is stored exclusively on your device in a local database. There is no server, no cloud sync, and no account system. The developer has no access to your data.

## Network Requests

The app makes network requests solely to fetch weather forecast data from one of the following providers, depending on your configuration:

- **Open-Meteo** (open-meteo.com)
- **National Weather Service** (weather.gov)

These requests include your configured location (GPS coordinates, zip code, postal code, or city name) for the purpose of retrieving local weather forecasts. No other data is included in these requests.

No other network requests are made by the app.

## Location Data

If you grant location permission, GPS coordinates are used only to fetch weather forecasts and to auto-detect your temperature unit preference. Location data is not stored permanently, transmitted to the developer, or shared with any third party. You can manually enter a location instead of using GPS.

## Analytics and Tracking

The app contains no analytics SDKs, no telemetry, no crash reporting, no advertising frameworks, and no third-party tracking of any kind.

## Data Export

You can export your data at any time as JSON or CSV from the app's settings screen. Exported files are saved to your device and are entirely under your control.

## Auto-Backup

When enabled, auto-backup saves a copy of your database to your device's local storage. This backup remains on your device and is not transmitted anywhere. It is used to restore data if you reinstall the app.

## Children's Privacy

The app does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Third-Party Services

The app does not integrate with any third-party services other than the weather providers listed above. There are no ads, no social media SDKs, and no data-sharing agreements.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted at this URL. The "last updated" date at the top of this page will be revised.
